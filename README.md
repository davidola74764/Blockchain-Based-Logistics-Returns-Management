# Blockchain-Based Logistics Returns Management

A decentralized solution for managing product returns across the retail supply chain. This platform leverages blockchain technology to create transparent, efficient, and auditable returns processes.

## Overview

This system enables retail ecosystem participants to:
- Verify legitimate business entities involved in returns processing
- Manage and authorize product return requests
- Track the movement of returned items through the reverse supply chain
- Handle disposition decisions for returned products efficiently

## Core Smart Contracts

### 1. Retailer Verification Contract
- Validates legitimate business entities within the returns ecosystem
- Manages retailer identity and credentials
- Stores essential business information (locations, product categories, policies)
- Creates a trusted network of verified retail participants
- Enables reputation scoring based on returns handling

### 2. Return Authorization Contract
- Manages approval workflow for product returns
- Validates return eligibility based on configurable policies
- Issues unique return authorization identifiers
- Documents return reason codes and customer information
- Calculates refund amounts and restocking fees when applicable

### 3. Transportation Tracking Contract
- Monitors movement of returned items throughout the reverse supply chain
- Records chain of custody with timestamped handoffs
- Validates condition checks at transfer points
- Alerts stakeholders to exceptions or delays
- Provides location visibility of items in transit

### 4. Disposition Contract
- Handles decisions on returned product processing
- Manages routing logic (restock, refurbish, recycle, destroy, etc.)
- Tracks inventory adjustments resulting from returns
- Documents condition assessments and value recovery
- Ensures compliance with regulatory requirements for disposal
